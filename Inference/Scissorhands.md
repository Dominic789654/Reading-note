**Abstract**:  
The paper introduces **Scissorhands**, a novel system designed to reduce the memory usage of Key-Value (KV) caches in Large Language Models (LLMs) during inference, based on the "Persistence of Importance Hypothesis." This hypothesis posits that only a subset of tokens, which have had significant influence at one step, will continue to be influential in future steps. Scissorhands utilizes this insight to compress the KV cache by discarding non-essential tokens while maintaining model performance. The system achieves up to a 5× reduction in KV cache memory usage without compromising model quality and can be combined with 4-bit quantization for further compression.

### 1. Introduction

- **Motivation**: Large Language Models (LLMs) require significant memory resources during inference, particularly due to the size of the KV cache. The KV cache can become a bottleneck, especially as the sequence length and batch size increase.
  
- **Objective**: The paper proposes Scissorhands, a method to maintain KV cache memory under a fixed budget without the need for model fine-tuning, leveraging the Persistence of Importance Hypothesis.

### 2. Persistence of Importance Hypothesis

- **Hypothesis**: The hypothesis suggests that only pivotal tokens, which have shown substantial influence in one step, will continue to influence future steps. This allows for the prediction of which tokens will be important in future generations, enabling the reduction of the KV cache by discarding non-influential tokens.

- **Verification**: Empirical results demonstrate a high persistence ratio (over 95% in most transformer layers), supporting the hypothesis and showing that most influential tokens continue to be important in future steps.

### 3. Scissorhands Methodology

- **KV Cache Compression**: Scissorhands compresses the KV cache by selectively keeping only the most influential tokens based on their attention scores. The system periodically evaluates and discards tokens that are unlikely to be pivotal in future steps.

- **Implementation**:
  - **Algorithm 1**: Manages the KV cache under a fixed memory budget.
  - **Algorithm 2**: Compresses the KV cache by dropping tokens with low influence scores while keeping recent tokens to account for their unknown importance.
  
- **Compatibility with Quantization**: Scissorhands can be combined with 4-bit quantization, achieving further memory reductions without additional accuracy loss.

### 4. Experimental Results

- **Datasets and Models**: Evaluations were performed on various models like OPT-6B, OPT-13B, and OPT-66B using datasets such as C4 and downstream tasks including Hellaswag, MathQA, PIQA, and Winogrande.

- **Results**: Scissorhands achieves up to a 5× reduction in KV cache memory usage with no noticeable loss in model accuracy, particularly as model size increases. The method also shows compatibility with 4-bit quantization.

### 5. Conclusion

- **Contributions**:
  - Scissorhands introduces a novel approach to KV cache compression based on the Persistence of Importance Hypothesis.
  - The system significantly reduces memory usage during inference while preserving model quality.
  - Future work will explore further optimizations and apply Scissorhands to larger models and different architectures.

- **Implications**: The findings suggest that selective token retention based on attention scores can be an effective strategy for reducing memory usage in LLMs, opening up possibilities for more efficient large-scale inference.

**Code Availability**: The implementation details and code are currently under review and will be made available upon acceptance.
